 	This work, was done in the context of my undergraduate dissertation 
"Remote control of electric mower". The brain of the lawnmower is a raspberry pi 3b, 
which receives commands via tcp / ip and translates them into commands on the power 
board that drives the motors.

 	The electronic board was designed and manufactured by me. It has one mpu6050, 
one mcp4131 digital potentiometer, two L6207N, two ina226 and one NLAS4684. Î¤he exact 
description and schematics I might upload as soon as the project is finished.
